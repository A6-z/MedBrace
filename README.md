Medsy – Wearable Monitoring System for Day Hospital Patients
Medsy is an academic project developed as part of a biomedical engineering curriculum. The project involves the design and implementation of a wearable device capable of measuring key physiological parameters—heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and body temperature—and transmitting this data via Bluetooth to a companion mobile application. The system is intended to support healthcare professionals in monitoring patients in day hospitals or intermediate care units.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to explore affordable, real-time patient monitoring solutions using microcontroller-based wearable devices and mobile technology. This system is not intended for commercial distribution or clinical use and has not undergone regulatory certification.

Features
Wearable Device
Built using an Arduino-compatible microcontroller (ESP32)

Integrated sensors for:

Heart rate, SpO₂ and Body Temperature (MAX30102)

Wireless data transmission via Bluetooth (ESP32)

Mobile Application
Developed using MIT App Inventor

Displays real-time physiological data from the wearable

Alerts healthcare staff when predefined thresholds are exceeded

Designed for use in supervised clinical settings

System Architecture
Hardware: Arduino microcontroller, physiological sensors, Bluetooth module, and battery-powered enclosure

Software: Arduino IDE (firmware) and MIT App Inventor (mobile app)

Platform: Android mobile devices

Terms and Conditions
This application is intended for use by authorized healthcare professionals only. It is designed to display real-time biometric data including heart rate (FC), body temperature, and oxygen saturation (SpO₂), transmitted from a wearable medical device used by patients in a day hospital setting. The application does not collect, store, or transmit any patient data. All displayed data is temporary and is automatically discarded after the session ends. No personally identifiable information is processed by the application.

Use of this application is limited to clinical environments and must comply with all applicable data protection and privacy regulations. The application is not a diagnostic tool and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical judgment. By using this application, the user confirms they are a licensed healthcare provider and understand that the application is only intended to support, not replace, clinical decisions.

The developers of this application disclaim any liability for medical decisions or patient outcomes resulting from its use. By continuing, the user acknowledges and agrees to these terms and conditions.

Disclaimer
This is an academic prototype developed solely for educational purposes. It is not approved for clinical use and does not meet medical device regulatory standards. The system must not be used to inform or replace clinical decision-making. Always consult a licensed medical professional for diagnosis and treatment.
